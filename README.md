# Proy_Medallero_Olympico
This was a project that was developed in the Fundamentals of Programming course at CENFOTEC University, in which he went from the most basic to creating a code capable of counting the medals obtained by the teams participating in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The same code is capable of calculating the counts of the medals, converting the gold medals into 3 points, the silver medals into 2 points, and the bronze medals into the same point, at the end the sum of the points obtained is obtained. . , and the winning country. Also for the final delivery, make a code in JavaScript language with design technologies such as HTML and CSS, in which, create a visual interface that will do the same as the JAVA code. The project has important documentation such as Diagrams in PSEINT, which allowed me to understand the programming logic, filling in tables and a presentation of the final project in ppt. I hope you like it, it is a basic but very nice project.
